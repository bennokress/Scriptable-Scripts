# Scriptable Scripts

My Scriptable Creations in one place. Please let me know if you see possibilities for improvement. Since I'm no JavaScript developer, I'm sure not everything is perfect with my code â€¦

## COVID-19 Global Vaccination
Small Widget showing vaccination data for 3 countries. Data comes from the [Github Repo](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data) of [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&country=DEU~CAN~USA&region=World&vaccinationsMetric=true&interval=total&aligned=true&perCapita=true&smoothing=0&pickerMetric=location&pickerSort=asc) and the widget displays the vaccination progress of the population from Germany, Canada and the US. Displayed is the progress in percent and as a progress bar as well as the total of new vaccinations in one day.

## COVID-19 Global Incidence
Small Widget showing the 7-Day incidence data for 3 countries as used in Germany: the sum of all new cases in the last 7 days divided by population and multiplied by 100.000. The arrow indicates a significant tendency compared to the day before (difference > 5) or if the difference is less than 5 then the week before (stable indicator if the difference there is less then 10 or contrary to the tendency compared to the day before). Data comes from the [Johns Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region) via the [COVID-19 API](https://covid19-api.org/).
